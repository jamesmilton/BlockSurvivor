#BlockSurvivor

This is the development of an interactive adventure game, using multimedia including audio, video and images to simulate
the experience of a new inmate entering into a South American jail. 

The original code source used was for an interactive video experience The Man from MOFO, set in a totalitarian state
similar to the one found in 1984 or Brazil.
